# Elegoo-HC-SR04-library-online

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
THIS IS NOT MINE. It is from Elegoo's The Most Complete Starter Kit Mega 2560 Project CD. I uploaded it online because I could not upload a .zip file to hackster.io since it is the library I used with this hackster.io project.

To install the HC-SR04 library, click on HC-SR04 (right above README.md) and then there is a button that says "Download". Click this button to install the .zip file which is the library to include on Arduino.
