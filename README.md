# Elegoo-HC-SR04-library-online

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
THIS IS NOT MINE. It is from Elegoo's The Most Complete Starter Kit Mega 2560 Project. I uploaded it online because I could not upload a .zip file to hackster.io since it is the library I used with this hackster.io project.

When you download from code>download zip, PLEASE EXTRACT THE "Elegoo-Hc-Sr04-library-online". In that folder, there is another folder named "Elegoo-Hc-Sr04-library-online". In that folder, you will find the Hc-Sr04 zip file (This is the actuall library to include in arduino) and this README.md that says the Important notice and these instructions.
